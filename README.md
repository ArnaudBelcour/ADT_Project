# Relations Between Noun/Verb

These scripts search for relation between nouns and verbs from Pubmed abstracts.
It is for a project in a Text Mining and Analytics course.

moduleInstallation.py is used to install a module and his packages.
At the beginning it was implemented only to install nltk and his packages. Then I generalize it to install any python module. 
Technically, it's a hundred lines of code for doing three command lines in a terminal... :B

text_processing.py is the main script, it extracts abstracts from xml extracts from Pubmed, tokenizes an tags them.
